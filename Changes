      version of it. Bug report and patch from Mario Domgoergen RT#39820

    - Don't overwrite the User-Agent field if the caller has set it and

0.071 2006-06-25
    - Fixed broken is_error (broken in 0.07). Thanks to Tatsuhiko for the
      patch.

0.07  2006-06-18
    - Use $res->header('Content-Type') instead of $res->content_type, since
      the latter can return an array. Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for the
      patch.
    - $res->is_success, is_error, and is_redirect previously threw an exception
      when called with NoNetwork. They just work as 200 succesful request now,
      when the response is taken back from the cache. Thanks to Tatsuhiko
      Miyagawa for the patch.

0.06  2006-04-09
    - Fixed issue where content-type was not stored in the cache, and was
      thus blank on subsequent requests. Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for
      the patch.
    - Fixed issue with caching redirected (304) URIs. Thanks to Tatsuhiko
      Miyagawa for the patch.
    - Added is_error, is_redirect, is_success convenience methods to
      URI::Fetch::Response. Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for the patch.

0.05  2006-02-24
    - Added a ForceResponse option, which forces URI::Fetch->fetch to return
      a URI::Fetch::Response object even if the HTTP request fails for an
      unknown reason. Thanks to Tim Appnel for the patch.

0.04  2005-10-09
    - Added Thaw and Freeze options, which allow you to define the
      serialization and deserialization options that are used. Thanks to
      Tim Appnel for the patch.

0.03  2005-05-27
    - Added a NoNetwork option, allowing fetch to trust the cache completely
      and skip the HTTP request; or the option to do this only if the version
      in the cache is older than N seconds. [bradfitz]
    - Added a CacheEntryGrep option, to allow for not caching certain
      responses. [bradfitz]
    - Documentation fixes & clarifications. [bradfitz]

0.02  2005-05-25
    - Let the caller pass in their own UserAgent and ContentAlterHook.
      [bradfitz]
    - Be more strict about invalid parameters. [bradfitz]
    - Documentation fixes for URI::Fetch->fetch in the SYNOPSIS. Thanks
      to Naoya Ito for the note.
