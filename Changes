Revision history for URI::Fetch

0.06  2006.04.09

      thus blank on subsequent requests. Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for
      the patch.

      Miyagawa for the patch.

    - Added a ForceResponse option, which forces URI::Fetch->fetch to return
      a URI::Fetch::Response object even if the HTTP request fails for an
      unknown reason. Thanks to Tim Appnel for the patch.

0.04  2005.10.09

      and skip the HTTP request; or the option to do this only if the version
